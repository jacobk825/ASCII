        <h2>The ASCII Art Generator 5000 Elevator Pitch</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we want to draw something. Sometimes we want to draw something and save it the resulting masterpiece. Sometimes we might even want want to convert it to ASCII code 
            for easy dissemination over instant messaging. In order to alleviate this insatiable need, we have developed a tool using python that provides a canvas with ample options 
            for anyone to create their own work of art. Afterward, the image can be saved and/or converted into ASCII art!
